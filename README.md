## Todo And Contributing

All contributions are welcome! Here's a simple list of
features I've been thinking of implementing and improving:

 - Custom game mode
   + Some sort of custom game mode with settings that player can tweak
 - More visual effects, rainbow snake for example? :)
 - Possibly more "maps", with walls or random blocks to make the game harder
